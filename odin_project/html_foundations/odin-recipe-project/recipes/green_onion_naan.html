    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cups bread flour, plus more as needed</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

      <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>

      <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>
      Place bread flour in a bowl. Add salt and baking powder and give it a good
      whisk until evenly combined.
    </li>

    <li>
      Add in Greek yogurt gently, followed by green onions. Take a wooden spoon
      and slowly start mixing everything together. Keep mixing, stirring, and
      pressing until a shaggy dough forms.
    </li>

    <li>
      Transfer dough to a work surface and use your hands to press dough
      together. Knead for a few minutes until dough becomes elastic and a little
      bit sticky. Add a bit more flour as necessary but try to keep extra flour
      at an absolute minimum. Knead until dough is a little bit stretchy, 3 to 5
      minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
      Wrap in plastic and allow to rest on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
      Take a bench scraper and cut into 6 equal pieces. Take 1 portion and roll
      into a ball. Place onto a generously floured surface. Use a rolling pin to
      roll out nice and thin, about 1/8 inch or less. It's ok if the naan is not
      a perfect circle. You will need extra flour for rolling out as the dough
      is sticky, but try to use as little as possible.
    </li>

    <li>
      Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Transfer dough
      circles into the hot dry skillet and cook until little bubbles form on the
      surface and the underside is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Flip naan
      over and cook for 1 more minute. Press down slightly with a spatula to
      increase the heat during cooking. Flip over twice more and cook for an
      additional 15 seconds per side, but make sure not to overcook to preserve
      the texture. Naan should still be flexible when you remove it from the
      skillet onto a plate.
    </li>

    <li>
      Cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm and moist while you cook the other
      naan breads. Stack all 6 naan breads on top of each other and keep covered
      with a kitchen towel.
    </li>

    <li>
      When you are finished cooking all 6 naan breads, unstack breads and brush
      the first naan bread on both sides with a little bit of melted butter.
      Stack second piece of naan on top and only brush the top side. Keep
      stacking and buttering all the naan breads. Fold each naan into a triangle
      and serve.
