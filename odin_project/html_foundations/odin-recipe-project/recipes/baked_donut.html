    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 1/4 cups (460g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dried yeast</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons (57g/2oz) butter</li>
      <li>1 cup (225ml) milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup (80ml) water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the flour, yeast, sugar and salt together in a standing mixer fitted
        with dough hook.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a measuring jug, heat together the milk, water, butter and heat until
        luke warm, and the butter is melted. Stir in the vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the machine on low and slowly add the milk mixture. Mix for 2
        minutes to wake up the yeast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run a spatula under the dough to make sure everything is mixed well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough is shiny and
        smooth, 6-8 minutes. The dough is supposed to be saggy and on the wet
        side
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub your mixing bowl with vegetable oil (or any flavorless oil) . Place
        the dough in the bowl and turn to coat lightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap tight and let the dough rise until
        doubled, 1 ½ -2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once it has risen, turn out the fluffy dough onto a floured work
        surface.
      </li>
      <li>Roll out to ½ “ thick</li>
      <li>
        Using a round cutter ( I used 3” but you can use smaller), cut of your
        donuts circles. Dust your cutter in flour so it doesn’t stick to the
        dough. Then cut out the donut hole with a much smaller cutter ( I used a
        piping nozzle , 1 ¼“ )
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to make donuts to stuff with Jelly or nutella then cut a
        plain round donuts (I used 2 ½” cutter)
      </li>
      <li>
        TIP: You can prepare the donuts to this stage and put in the
        refrigerator until the next day. When needed, take out and let me come
        to room temp and rise a little (roughly 30 minutes) and then bake off as
        instructed below. Fresh donuts for breakfast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover your donuts with cling film and let them rise at room temp for
        20-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C)</li>
      <li>
        Unwrap the donuts. Brush the very top (not the sides) with melted
        butter. Sprinkle the tray with 2 tblsp of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 13 minutes, set a timer. Rotate tray during baking if needed to
        get color all over. You want to bake these just enough. if they get too
        much color they can dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the donuts are baking making the glaze: Simply whisk all the
        ingredients together. Use more water if needed to get a thin glaze.
      </li>
